      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've had some postsecondary education at <strong>University of British Columbia</strong> and <strong>Bellevue
          College</strong> studying business management. In the past 3-4 years I've worked as a waiter at <strong>Yea's
          Wok</strong>. I've decided to take this programming bootcamp at <strong>Epicodus</strong> because I would like
        to have a career in the Tech industry. My dream job is to work at <em>Microsoft</em>.
